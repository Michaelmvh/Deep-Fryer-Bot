# Deep-Fryer-Bot
A Discord Bot that deep fries images on command

Commands:
!deepfry {image-url}  --> "Deep Fries" the linked image
!bottomtext {image-url} --> Adds the words "Bottom Text" to the linked image
!meme {image-url} --> "Deep Fries" and adds "Bottom Text" to the linked image


To set up the bot for yourself, add a .env file with a discord bot token.
I currently have no plans to host the bot for public use.
